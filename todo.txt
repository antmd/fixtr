        trace only required

        remove expanded components [replace in copy with lookup children]

        multiple FIX version in same stream - load all FIX specs, jump based on header


        FIXT1.1 ??

        indicate bad values for enum fields [if enums are in spec]



    HISTORY


      20010.01.27

        fixspec takes spec arg - then compare FIX50SP2.xml with FIX44.xml

        used FIX50SP2.xml as basis for fixspec... fixspec D works ok

        FIX50SP2.xml generated from fiximate spec html files [and repo spec files Enums.xml and Fields.xml ]

        fixtr show enum field values

        group repeats : parse groups with n repeats

        msg tracing - readable summary on stderr in passthrough mode

        parse components with nested parse of the component

        sample messages are mis-ordered a lot, so allow any ordering - gather all nodes into map for msg type expanded[id]=expanded map [no stack needed]
